This repo contains any [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) formulae I 
create. It started because my
[netpgp](https://github.com/rnelson/brew/blob/master/netpgp.rb) 
formula was rejected ([for good
reasons](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/26538)), 
but I may add other things later.

To install a formula from here, do one of the following:

```
brew tap rnelson/brew
brew install <formula>
```

```
brew install rnelson/brew/<formula>
```
